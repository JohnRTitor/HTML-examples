    <h1>GYMNOSPERMS</h1>
    <p>
      Gymnosperms are vascular plants that reproduce via exposed seeds or
      ovules, unlike angiosperms, whose seeds are enclosed by fruits. Their
      seeds, often found in cones, are visible only at maturity. There are four
      divisions of gymnosperms: Pinophyta, Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, and
      Gnetophyta, comprising 88 genera and over 1,000 species worldwide.
      Gymnosperms were dominant during the Mesozoic Era and, although they have
      been largely replaced by angiosperms since the Cretaceous Period, they
      still thrive in many regions. Conifer forests, for example, span large
      areas of northern temperate lands.

    <h2><b>General Features of Gymnosperms</b></h2>
    <p>
      The visible part of gymnosperms is the sporophyte, representing the
      asexual generation. A typical sporophyte has a stem, roots, leaves, and
      reproductive structures. As vascular plants, gymnosperms have xylem and
      phloem tissues. The xylem conducts water and minerals from roots,
      providing structural support, while the phloem distributes nutrients from
      the leaves to the rest of the plant.
