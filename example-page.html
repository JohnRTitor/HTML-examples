    <h1>GYMNOSPERMS</h1>
    <p>
      Gymnosperm, any vascular plant that reproduces by means of an exposed
      seed, or ovule—unlike angiosperms, or flowering plants, whose seeds are
      enclosed by mature ovaries, or fruits. The seeds of many gymnosperms
      (literally, “naked seeds”) are borne in cones and are not visible until
      maturity. Taxonomists recognize four distinct divisions of extant
      (nonextinct) gymnospermous plants—Pinophyta, Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, and
      Gnetophyta—with 88 genera and more than 1,000 species distributed
      throughout the world. Gymnosperms were dominant in the Mesozoic Era (about
      252.2 million to 66 million years ago), during which time some of the
      modern families originated (Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, Cupressaceae).
      Although since the Cretaceous Period (about 145 million to 66 million
      years ago) gymnosperms have been gradually displaced by the more recently
      evolved angiosperms, they are still successful in many parts of the world
      and occupy large areas of Earth’s surface. Conifer forests, for example,
      cover vast regions of northern temperate lands, and gymnosperms frequently
      grow in more northerly latitudes than do angiosperms.

    <h2><b>General features of GYMNO-SPERM:- </b></h2>
    <p>
      In all living gymnosperm groups, the visible part of the plant body (i.e.,
      the growing stem and branches) represents the sporophyte, or asexual,
      generation, rather than the gametophyte, or sexual, generation. Typically,
      a sporophyte has a stem with roots and leaves and bears the reproductive
      structures. As vascular plants, gymnosperms contain two conducting
      tissues, the xylem and phloem. The xylem conducts water and minerals from
      the roots to the rest of the plant and also provides structural support.
      The phloem distributes the sugars, amino acids, and organic nutrients
      manufactured in the leaves to the nonphotosynthetic tissues of the plant.
