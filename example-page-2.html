    <h1>GYMNOSPERMS</h1>
    <h2><b>Characteristics of Gymnosperms:-</b><br /></h2>
    <h3>Following are the important characteristics of gymnosperms:<br /></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They do not produce flowers.</li>
      <li>Seeds are not formed inside a fruit. They are naked.</li>
      <li>They are found in colder regions where snowfall occurs.</li>
      <li>They develop needle-like leaves.</li>
      <li>They are perennial or woody, forming trees or bushes.</li>
      <li>They are not differentiated into ovary, style and stigma.</li>
      <li>Since stigma is absent, they are pollinated directly by the wind.</li>
      <li>
        The male gametophytes produce two gametes, but only one of them is
        functional.
      </li>
      <li>They form cones with reproductive structures.</li>
      <li>
        The seeds contain endosperm that stores food for the growth and
        development of the plant.
      </li>
      <li>
        These plants have vascular tissues which help in the transportation of
        nutrients and water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Xylem does not have vessels and the phloem has no companion cells and
        sieve tubes
      </li>
    </ul>
