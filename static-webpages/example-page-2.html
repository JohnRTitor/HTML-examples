    <h2><b>Characteristics of Gymnosperms</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No flowers; seeds are exposed.</li>
      <li>Common in colder regions with snowfall.</li>
      <li>Needle-like leaves; perennial or woody.</li>
      <li>No differentiation into ovary, style, and stigma.</li>
      <li>Wind pollinated; male gametophytes produce one functional gamete.</li>
      <li>Cones with reproductive structures.</li>
      <li>Seeds with endosperm for nourishment.</li>
      <li>Vascular tissues for nutrient and water transport.</li>
      <li>Xylem lacks vessels; phloem lacks companion cells and sieve tubes.</li>
    </ul>
